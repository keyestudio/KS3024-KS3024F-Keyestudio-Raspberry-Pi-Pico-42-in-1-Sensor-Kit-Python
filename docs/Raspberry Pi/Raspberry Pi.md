![](/media/3e0526d601054847d1b1feee8384dbbe.png)

### 2. Install Raspberry Pi OS on Raspberry Pi

Interface the TFT memory card with a card reader, then plug the card reader into a computer’s USB port.

Use the SD Card Formatter to format a TFT memory card, as illustrated below.

![](/media/79d747e6f00f857a593b3327397cc44f.png)

![](/media/cbc55902de71ce984d873ca2cb67fffa.png)

![](/media/82031b5354cc4edeccf2bfa7465b7c6c.png)

#### (1) Burn system

Burn the Raspberry Pi OS to the TFT memory card using Win32 Disk Imager software.

![](/media/80d236cae8bdf63d80dc65048ffb52b3.png)

![](/media/243d1ef34211eafe1a92b67fc0ee85a2.png)

![](/media/ea854c476e9a8d4f82dd4a7c714cd5af.png)

Don’t eject card reader after burning mirror system, build a file named SSH, then delete .txt.

The SSH login function can be activated by copying SSH file to boot category, as shown below.

![](/media/ffb73310322accd671da373bb2e71945.png)

Eject card reader.

#### (2) Log in system

(Raspberry and PC should be in the same local area network.) 

Insert TFT memory card into Raspberry Pi, connect internet cable and plug in power. If you have screen and HDMI cable of Raspberry Pi, you could view Raspberry Pi OS activating. If not, you can enter the desktop of Raspberry Pi via SSH remote login software---WinSCP and xrdp.

#### (3) Remote login

**Enter default user name, password and host name on WinSCP to log in. Only a Raspberry Pi is connected in same network.**

![](/media/0a41d5c629ec98afbc31dc47ff5c18ec.png)

![](/media/ff64e71b9e30df60d0b099dbc2532587.png)

#### (4) Check IP and mac address

![](/media/a4285a452978026c9e60c31d35974315.png)

Click to open terminal and input the password: raspberry, and press “Enter” on keyboard.

![](/media/a433a9ee584c821a702d0250937e2ba8.png)

![](/media/7fb10d842cc7fd824a325d30fc3ecdc7.png)

Logging in successfully, open the terminal, input **ip a** and tap “Enter” to check IP and mac address.

![](/media/132e9ab754a0f63e38b3e4cfbc3679f2.png)

From the above figure, mac address of this Raspberry Pi is dc:a6:32:17:61:9c, and IP address is 192.168.1.128(use IP address to finish xrdp remote login).

Since mac address never changes, you could confirm IP via mac address when not sure which IP it is.

#### (5) Fix IP address of Raspberry Pi

IP address is changeable, therefore, we need to make IP address fixed for convenient use.

Follow the below steps:

Switch to root user

If without root user’s password

① Set root password

Input password in the terminal: sudo passwd root to set password.

② Switch to root user

su root

③ Fix the configuration file of IP address

Firstly change IP address of the following configuration file.

(\#New IP address: address 192.168.1.99)

Copy the above new address to terminal and press“Enter”.

**Configuration File:**

echo -e '

auto eth0

iface eth0 inet static

\#Change IP address

address 192.168.1.99

netmask 255.255.255.0

gateway 192.168.1.1

network 192.168.1.0

broadcast 192.168.1.255

dns-domain 119.29.29.29

dns-nameservers 119.29.29.29

metric 0

mtu 1492

'\>/etc/network/interfaces.d/eth0

![](/media/a68a4f59d4d364efa28b6680a2c48d43.png)

④ Reboot the system to activate the configuration file.

Input the restart command in the terminal: sudo reboot

You could log in via fixed IP afterwards.

⑤ Check IP and insure IP address fixed well.

#### (6) Log in desktop on Raspberry Pi wirelessly

In fact, we can log in desktop on Raspberry Pi wirelessly even without screen and HDMI cable.

VNC and Xrdp are commonly used to log in desktop of Raspberry Pi wirelessly. Let’s take example of Xrdp.

Install Xrdp Service in the terminal

**Installation commands:**

Switch to Root User: su root

Installation: apt-get install xrdp

Enter y and press “Enter”.

![](/media/aa59941ff4c1e582e8183c1dc3767fce.png)

Open the remote desktop connection on Windows

Press WIN+R on keyboard and enter mstsc.exe.

![](/media/e5a66a3a1c998f8feb1c21c7a457ec4e.png)

Input IP address of Raspberry Pi, as shown below.

Click “Connect” and tap “Connect”.

192.168.1.99 is IP address we use, you could change into your IP address.

![](/media/c41c66bea61b30019e02a74b483af700.png)

Click “Yes”.

![](/media/297813f1370ce5c158fac61511f61295.png)

Input user name: pi, default password: raspberry, as shown below.

![](/media/251fddc1decc15d0b69f8a0c7467d5c1.png)

Click “OK” or “Enter”, you will view the desktop of Raspberry Pi OS, as shown below.

![](/media/56bd5693edd484c4433dc438b58c6130.png)

Now, we finish the basic configuration of Raspberry Pi OS.

### 3. Raspberry Pi Pico

![](/media/8f4fd948c7ba2a57de1f13bfafcbc57a.jpeg)

At the end of January 2021, the Raspberry Pi Foundation launched the Raspberry Pi Pico, which received a lot of attention due to its high-performance and low-cost.

The size of Pico is 21mm × 51mm, which is similar to Arduino Nano’s.

![](/media/c88af883129afa6bbbbaf4c602c5cd17.jpeg)

Raspberry Pi Pico is a low-cost, high-performance microcontroller board with flexible digital interfaces. It integrates RP2040 microcontroller chip designed by Raspberry Pi, with dual-core Arm Cortex M0+ processor running up to 133 MHz, embedded 264KB of SRAM and 2MB of on-board Flash memory, as well as 26 multi-function GPIO pins. For software development, either Raspberry Pi's C/C++ SDK, or the MicroPython is available. In this tutorial, we will use MicroPython.

![](/media/5af80ccb1a66b3d5c95f7e6332c14aaf.jpeg)

The bare board does not come with pins and you need to solder them yourself. This is a well-made board that can also be used as an SMD component and soldered directly to a printed circuit board.

![](/media/5559aecae75a907d128fe917f0d439cf.png)

The most predominant feature on the board is the microUSB connector at one end. This is used both for communication and to supply power to the Pico. An on-board LED is mounted next to the microUSB connector, it is internally connected to GPIO pin 25. It’s worthwhile to note that this is the only LED on the entire Pico board. 

The BOOTSEL pushbutton switch is mounted a bit down from the LED, it allows you to change the boot mode of the Pico so that you can load MicroPython onto it and perform drag-and-drop programming.

At the bottom of the board, you’ll see three connections, these are for a serial Debug option that we won’t be exploring here.

In the center of the board is the brains of the whole thing, the RP2040 MCU, which is capable of supporting up to 16MB of off-chip Flash memory, although in the Pico there is only 4MB.

  - Dual-core 32-bit Arm Cortex M0+ processor

  - Runs at 48MHz, but can be overclocked to 133MHz

  - 30 GPIO pins(26 exposed)

  - Can support USB Host or Device mode

  - 8 Programmable I/O(PIO) state machines

![](/media/cb29ae0ae38fa37cfab6fa455cacc649.png)

The Pico is a 3.3V logic device, however, it can be powered with a range of power supplies thanks to a built-in voltage converter and regulator.

**GND:** Ground connection. 8 grounding wires plus an additional one on the 3-pin Debug connector. They are square as opposed to rounded like the other connections.

**VBUS:** This is the power from the microUSB bus, 5V. If the Pico is not being powered by the microUSB connector then there will be no output here.

**VSYS:** This is the input voltage, which can range from 2 to 5V. The on-board voltage converter will change it to 3.3V for the Pico.

**3V3:** This is a 3.3V output from the Pico’s internal regulator. It can be used to power additional components, providing you keep the load under 300ma.

**3V3\_EN:** You can use this input to disable the Pico’s internal voltage regulator, which will shut off the Pico and any components powered by it.

**RUN:** It can enable or disable the RP2040 microcontroller, it can also reset it.

![](/media/0e74531a0bf3e972325003fe51c51bd4.png)

There are 26 exposed GPIO connections on the Raspberry Pi Pico board. They are laid out pretty-well in order, with a “gap” between GP22 and GP26 (those “missing” pins are used internally). All these pins have multiple functions, and you can configure up to 16 of them for PWM. There are two I2C buses, two UARTs, and two SPI buses, these can be configured to use a wide variety of GPIO pins. 

The Pico has three Analog-to-Digital Converters, they are ADC0-GP26, ADC1-GP27, ADC2-GP28, and plus ADC-VREF converter used internally for an on-board temperature sensor. Note: The ADCs have a 12-bit resolution. However, the MicroPython has scaled the 12-bit resolution into a 16-bit resolution, which means that we will receive ADC values from 0 to 65535. The microcontroller’s working voltage is 3.3V, indicating that 0 corresponds to 0V and 65535 corresponds to 3.3V.

You can also provide an external precision voltage-reference on the ADC_VREF pin. One of the grounds, the ADC_GND on pin 33 is used as a ground point for that reference.

![](/media/5f7b34935150b0821800fe23c56110bd.png)

Raspberry Pi did release a ton of technical documentation, plus a great guide called **Get Started with MicroPython on Raspberry Pi Pico**. It’s available in softcover, and as a PDF download as well. For more information, please refer to:

[https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/)

### 4. Using MicroPython

#### Preperation

MicroPython is a lean and efficient implementation of the Python 3 programming language that includes a small subset of the Python standard library and is optimized to run on microcontrollers and in constrained environments. MicroPython is packed full of advanced features such as an interactive prompt, arbitrary precision integers, closures, list comprehension, generators, exception handling and more. Yet it is compact enough to fit and run within just 256k of code space and 16k of RAM. MicroPython aims to be as compatible with normal Python as possible to allow you to transfer code with ease from the desktop to a microcontroller or embedded system. 

For more information, please go to the official website: [https://micropython.org](https://micropython.org)

**Programming the Pico:** 

You could use C/C++ or MicroPython. MicroPython is an interpreted language that is made specifically for microcontrollers. Many microcontroller users have familiarity with C/C++ as they are used on the Arduino and ESP32 boards. In this tutorial, we will use Thonny recommended by Raspberry Pi. Thonny bills itself as a“Python IDE for Beginners”, and it is available for Windows, Mac OSX and Linux. It was also part of the Raspberry Pi operating system(formerly Raspbian).

**Boot and Install MicroPython:** 

The first thing that we need to do is to get MicroPython installed onto the Pico.

**Download and burn firmware**

Go to the official website to download the UF2 file:

[https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/\#getting-started-with-micropython](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/#getting-started-with-micropython，)

What I downloaded is![](/media/b9acf3a180cc573115d6956dd97473a6.png). Once the download is complete, we proceed to burn the firmware.

With BOOTSEL held down, then plug the Pico into Raspberry Pi or your computer’s USB port.

Release it after the connection was finished. You should see a drive appearing on your computer with the name“RPI-RP2”.

![](/media/fea09bd325ab8872862583c0898cefb9.png)

Move the UF2 file into “RPI-RP2”, and the Raspberry Pi Pico will automatically restart. At this point, the burning is complete.

![](/media/2b92b23b34ad785e441050dda48f4cd1.png)

#### **Connect the Pico from a Raspberry Pi over USB**

The MicroPython firmware is equipped with a virtual USB serial port which is accessed through the micro USB connector on Raspberry Pi Pico. Your computer should notice this serial port and list it as a character device, most likely /dev/ttyACM0.

You can run<span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 255);"> ls /dev/tty*</span> to list your serial ports. There may be quite a few, but MicroPython’s USB serial will start with /dev/ttyACM. If in doubt, unplug the micro USB connector and see which one disappears. If you don’t see anything, you can try rebooting your Raspberry Pi.

Enter the following command to install minicom:

<span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 255);">sudo apt install minicom</span>

![](/media/446a7c06287ab5dad20b372e7b4fb409.png)

open it as such:

<span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 255);">minicom -o -D /dev/ttyACM0</span>

![](/media/ffbca82d2585a6c716390e05e8d6efba.png)

Press Ctrl + B.

![](/media/4ce46e1813574740300c02558d3b6a78.png)

Enter <span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 255);">print ("hello world")</span>, it will show “hello world”.

![](/media/2af344f21b35759955c8e1ed469d897f.png)

The on-board LED on Raspberry Pi Pico is connected to GPIO pin 25. The **machine** module is used to control on-chip hardware. This is standard on all MicroPython ports. Here we are using it to take control of a GPIO, so we can drive it high and low. If you type this in to light up the LED.

<span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 255);">from machine import Pin</span>

<span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 255);">led = Pin(25, Pin.OUT)</span>

<span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 255);">led.value(1)</span>

![](/media/fe8f847fa40eacf2bcd8f24cc9d7b5db.png)

You can turn the LED off with:

<span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 255);">led.value(0)</span>

![](/media/0cb1575e8cb7c0a95e0f08c305905335.png)

Now we have successfully connected the Pico from a Raspberry Pi over USB.

#### **Install Thonny**

The Raspberry Pi Imager that we downloaded comes with some commonly used software, and Thonny is among them.

![](/media/3ca36d4733dbbbb82d82572c24c7d63d.png)

If the Raspberry Pi Imager does not have Thonny, you need to manually download it yourself. Enter the following command in the terminal to download and install Thonny.

<span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 255);">sudo apt install thonny</span>

When opening Thonny for the first time select "Standard Mode" in the top right of the window. Open Thonny again, the interface is shown in the figure below.

![](/media/a8bcc7174c4dba688f1336f215e7b34a.png)

Select "MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)" from the list, as shown below.

![](/media/336ca9ecc12b7a07f37cff36491253d4.png)

Click “Tools” and “Options”.

![](/media/7abc24e9a41c82fce2b40dfb965fc97c.png)

![](/media/5e4f37a816a51859152e04054aa68d3e.png)

Click “Edit”, these are some options about code, such as copying, cutting, pasting.

![](/media/4664d6d018c346bae517ab7c53236edf.png)

In the View drop-down menu, these are tools to assist you. 

For example, if we do not tick Shell (the Shell is the“command line”of the Pico, and you can execute code directly here.), the result won’t be displayed. 

Click “Files”, the files we saved will be shown on the left.

![](/media/096012bd728ecc7f3b83a476eaaae88e.png)

We can select interpreter in the Run drop-down menu, there are also some shortcuts used in programming.

We can open programs saved on the Raspberry Pi or the Pico, or save them on This computer or Raspberry Pi Pico.

Copy the code below to the Thonny and save it to the Pico as test.py.

```python
from machine import Pin, Timer
led = Pin(25, Pin.OUT)
tim = Timer()
def tick(timer):
    global led
    led.toggle()
tim.init(freq=2.5, mode=Timer.PERIODIC, callback=tick)
```

Click ![](/media/5df8ee106f3f7e2a3cab589ccac6934b.png) to run the code, the on-board LED will blink, then click ![](/media/ebb4ab42307b2b2d84cf6fa2dd971fd6.png) to stop, the LED won’t blink. 

If we unplug the MicroUSB cable and plug it in again, the LED won’t blink after powering up. This is because we did not name the file main.py and save it to the Pico. 

Click “File”, then click “Save as...” to choose Raspberry Pi Pico. After that, enter main.py as the file name (don’t forget to enter the .py file extension) and click “OK”. Run the code again, the LED will continue to blink.

![](/media/df73855c0dd7f29cc4fc4dabe5ed1147.png)

When we unplug the cable again, then plug it in and power on, the LED will blink. This is because the Raspberry Pi Pico starts running the program saved on main.py after powering up.

#### **Add Modules**

Python is a powerful language due to its modules. Python scripting language with the most rich and powerful class library, enough to support the vast majority of day-to-day applications. By importing modules, this makes it easier for us when using some complex sensors. 

The method is simple, just save the module that we need to the Pico, or open the file saved on our computer, click“File” to choose “Save as”, then save it to the Pico board (right click the mouse, you can delete files). For instance, I saved some library files required for these courses on my Pico. Click“View”to choose“Files”, they will be displayed on the left of the interface.

![](/media/82923d59e018fd32c1c2836a3c0b470a.png)

When using sensors, we can import the corresponding modules directly.

![](/media/2d5a05351f23a99bddb011d6186c685a.png)

We save all the code in this tutorial to the Raspberry Pi. Open the terminal and create a folder in /home/pi.

![](/media/19c626dbfa3928bb73e86e3f5f67f8af.png)

Copy the code to the folder and enter ls, it will show the following content.

![](/media/6271e5c2593ad77d2575bbfc6953c80a.png)

When using Thonny, we open this path to find the code we saved directly.

## Projects

There are 37 sensors and modules in this kit. Next, we will analyze and introduce how they work step by step. Interface sensors with the Raspberry Pi Pico board and the Pico shield, run test codes and observe experimental phenomenon.

**Note: please wire up components according to the given connection diagrams.**

### Project 1: Lighting up LED

![](/media/ce8d61c97eb89c94c05cc1f6299316b5.jpeg)

#### **Overview**

In this project, we will make an experiment to light up the white LED module. The high and low levels can be controlled by programming, then the state of the LED can be controlled.

#### **Working Principle**

The two circuit diagrams are given. The left one is wrong wiring-up diagram. Why? Theoretically, when the S terminal outputs high levels, LED will receive the voltage and light up. 

Due to limitation of IO ports of Pico board, weak current can’t make LED brighten.

The right one is correct wiring-up diagram. GND and VCC are powered up. When the S terminal is a high level, the triode Q1 will be connected and LED will light up (note: current passes through LED and R3 to reach GND by VCC not IO ports). Conversely, when the S terminal is a low level, the triode Q1 will be disconnected and LED will go off.

The triode Q1 is equal to a switch and R1 and R3 stand for limited resistors which can curb the size of current to prevent from burning out components.

![](/media/668ba35c4cf06ea9d8e082365144f1ef.png)

#### **Code Explanation**

1\. **Machine** 

Machine module is indispensable, we will use **import machine** or **from machine import...** to program pico with microPython.

2\. **time.sleep()** 

This function is used to set delayed time, as **time.sleep(0.01),** which means, the delayed time is 10ms.

3\. **led = Pin(0, Pin.OUT)**

created a pin example and we name **led.**

**0** is indicative of connected pin GP0, **Pin.OUT represents output mode**, it can use **.value()** to output high levels (3.3V) **led.value(1)** or low levels (0V) **led.value(0)**. 

4\. **import machine** 

It is used to import modules. When creating pins examples, it will change into **led = machine.Pin(0, machine.Pin.OUT).**

5\. **while True** 

It is loop function.

It means that sentences under this function will loop unless **True** changes into **False.** For the function **while**，**led.value(1)**, outputs high levels to the pin 0; then LED lights up. Then the delayed function **time.sleep(1)** will wait for 1s. When **led.value(0)** output low levels to the pin 0, the LED will go off，and the function **time.sleep(1)** will wait for 1s, cyclically, and LED will flash.

#### **Test Result**

Code 1: upload the code and power on, the purple LED on the module will  light up

Code 2: upload the code and power on, the purple LED will flash with the interval of 1s.

### Project 2: Traffic Lights Module

![](/media/e191c790f251715b418bcfd39a32917f.jpeg)

#### **Overview**

In this lesson, we will learn how to control multiple LED lights and simulate the operation of traffic lights.

Traffic lights are signal devices positioned at road intersections, pedestrian crossings, and other locations to control flows of traffic.

In this kit, we will use the traffic light module to simulate the traffic light.

#### **Working Principle**

In previous lesson, we already know how to control an LED. In this part, we only need to control three separated LEDs. Output high levels to the signal R(3.3V), then the red LED will be on.

![](/media/a71636692a0934b326ebac5eaf9f0f60.png)

#### **Code Explanation**

Create pins, set pins mode and delayed functions.

We use the **for** loop.

The simplest form is **for i in range()**.

In the code, we used range(3), which means the variable i starts from 0, increase 1 for each time, to 2.

#### **Test Result**

Run the code, the green LED will be on for 5s then off, the yellow LED will flash for 3s then go off and the red one will be on for 5s then off.

### Project 3: Laser Sensor

![](/media/d5d84e9d26d2cc89772a05eed6340bc0.jpeg)

#### **Description**

Lasers are widely used to cut, weld, surface treat, and more on specific materials. The energy of the laser is very high. The toy laser pointer may cause glare to the human eye, and it may cause retinal damage for a long time. my country also prohibits the use of laser to illuminate the aircraft.

#### **Working Principle**

The laser head sensor module is mainly composed of a laser head with a light-emitting die, a condenser lens, and a copper adjustable sleeve.

We can see the circuit schematic diagram of this module which is very similar to the LED we have learned. They are all driven by triodes. A high-level digital signal is directly input at the signal end, then the sensor will start to work; if inputting low levels, the sensor won’t work.

**Note: don’t point an laser emitter at eyes of people.**

### Project 4: Button Sensor

![](/media/4d5f6ea741d1e346e03f6efe7cfc9d2d.jpeg)

#### **Overview**

In this kit, there is a Keyestudio single-channel button module, which mainly uses a tact switch and comes with a yellow button cap.

In previous lessons, we learned how to make the pins of our single-chip microcomputer output a high level or low level. In this experiment, we will read the high level (3.3V) and low level (0V).

We can determine whether the button on the sensor is pressed by reading the high and low level of the S terminal on the sensor.

#### **Working Principle**

The button module has four pins. The pin 1 is connected to the pin 3 and the pin 2 is linked with the pin 4. When the button is not pressed, they are disconnected. Yet, when the button is pressed, they are connected. If the button is released, the signal end is high level.

![](/media/79c207d2032f12b39c540ea9863441e1.png)

#### **Code Explanation**

1\. **button = Pin(15, Pin.IN, Pin.PULL\_UP),** 

we define the pin of the button as GP15 and set to PULL-UP mode.

We can use **button = Pin(15, Pin.IN) to set INPUT mode,** at this time, the pins are in high resistance state.

2\. **button.value(),** read levels of buttons. Function returns High or Low.

3\. **if..else.. sentence,** 

4.When the logic judge is TRUE, the code under the if will be activated; otherwise, the code udder the else will be activated.

When pico detects the button pressed, the signal end is low level (GP 15 is low level). **button.value() is 0.** If pico detects the button unpressed, **button.value()** is 1 and else sentence will be activated.

#### **Test Result**

Upload the test code successfully. After powering on the USB cable, open the serial monitor and set the baud rate to 9600. The serial monitor will display the corresponding data and characters. When the button is pressed, val is 0, the monitor will show “Press the button”; when the button is released, val is 1, the monitor will show “Loosen the button”; as shown below.

#### **Description**

In this kit, there is a capacitive touch module which mainly uses a TTP223-BA6 chip. It is a touch detection chip, which provides a touch button, and its function is to replace the traditional button with a variable area button. When we power on, the sensor needs about 0.5 seconds to stabilize. Do not touch the keys during this time period. 

At this time, all functions are disabled, and self-calibration is always performed. The calibration period is about 4 seconds. We display the test results in the shell.

#### **Working Principle**

![](/media/7fe7f9d2bdf7b9b25e708c52d7dda66d.png)

When our fingers touch the module, the signal S outputs high levels, the red LED on the module flashes. We can determine if the button is pressed or not by reading high and low levels on the sensor.

### Project 6: Obstacle Avoidance Sensor

![](/media/e6dda88bb6faf8fc06d81361b7f48a3d.jpeg)

#### **Overview**

In this kit, there is a Keyestudio obstacle avoidance sensor, which mainly uses an infrared emitting and a receiving tube. In the experiment, we will determine whether there is an obstacle by reading the high and low level of the S terminal on the sensor.

#### **Working Principle**

NE555 circuit provides IR signals with frequency to the emitter TX, then the IR signals will fade with the increase of transmission distance. If encountering the obstacle, it will be reflected back.

When the receiver RX meets the weak signals reflected back, the receiving pin will output high levels, which indicates the obstacle is far away. On the contrary, it the reflected signals are stronger, low levels will be output, which represents the obstacle is close. There are two potentiometers on the module, and one is for adjusting emission power, another one is for receiving frequency.

#### **Code Explanation**

Run the code, we start to adjust the two potentiometers to sense distance.

1.  Adjust the potentiometer transmitting power. Make the P LED at the critical point of ON and OFF states.
    
2.  Adjust the potentiometer receiving frequency. Rotate it clockwise, the frequency will increase. Make the S LED at the critical point of ON and OFF states, then the 38KHz square wave can be produced.
    

#### **Test Result**

Run the code, when the sensor detects the obstacle, the Shell will show “There are obstacles”; if the obstacle is not detected, “All going well” will be shown.

### Project 7: Line Tracking Sensor

![](/media/deac96f3f54b7bedea5399a3aca20c71.jpeg)

#### **Description**

In this kit, there is a DIY electronic building block single-channel line tracking sensor which mainly uses a TCRT5000 reflective black and white line recognition sensor element.

In the experiment, we judge the color (black and white) of the object detected by the sensor by reading the high and low levels of the S terminal on the module; and display the test results on the shell.

#### **Working Principle**

![](/media/b4bec738ca3565a2ce3a274bfec4a57a.png)

When a black or no object is detected, the signal terminal will output high levels; when white object is detected, the signal terminal is low level; its detection height is 0-3cm. We can adjust the sensitivity by rotating the potentiometer on the sensor. When the potentiometer is rotated, the sensitivity is best when the red LED on the sensor is at the critical point between off and on.

### Project 9: Tilt Module

![](/media/9d4fcf498d8943539935d0f9638f22eb.jpeg)

#### **Overview**

In this kit, there is a Keyestudio tilt sensor. The tilt switch can output signals of different levels according to whether the module is tilted. There is a ball inside. When the switch is higher than the horizontal level, the switch is turned on, and when it is lower than the horizontal level, the switch is turned off. This tilt module can be used for tilt detection, alarm or other detection.

#### **Working Principle**

![](/media/7b5da31ecdd90419d5b3326eebdb14e7.png)

The working principle is pretty simple. When pin 1 and 2 of the ball switch P1 are connected, the signal S is low level and the red LED will light up; when they are disconnected, the pin will be pulled up by the 4.7K R1 and make S a high level, then LED will be off.

### Project 10: Collision Sensor

![](/media/d8d2179686c93a69087b20547fa9bdca.jpeg)

#### **Description**

The collision sensor uses a tact switch. This sensor is often used as a limit switch in 3D printers. In the experiment, we judge whether the sensor shrapnel is pressed down by reading the high and low levels of the S terminal on the module; and, we display the test results in the shell.

#### **Working Principle**

It mainly uses a tact switch. When the shrapnel of the tact switch is pressed, 2 and 3 are connected, the signal terminal S is low level, and the red LED on the module lights up; when the touch switch is not pressed, 2 and 3 are not connected, and 3 is pulled up to a high level by the 4.7K resistor R1, that is, the sensor signal terminal S is a high level, and the built-in red LED will be off at this time.

### Project 11: Hall Sensor

![](/media/3fa2bf365868256a8c9fe4f32c883c91.jpeg)

#### **Description**

In this kit, there is a Hall sensor which mainly adopts a A3144 linear Hall element. The element P1 is composed of a voltage regulator, a Hall voltage generator, a differential amplifier, a Schmitt trigger, a temperature compensation circuit and an open-collector output stage. In the experiment, we use the Hall sensor to detect the magnetic field and display the test results on the shell.

#### **Working Principle**

When the sensor detects no magnetic field or a north pole magnetic field, the signal terminal will be high level; when it senses a south pole magnetic field, the signal terminal will be low levels.

The stronger the magnetic field strength is, induction distance is longer.

### Project 12: Reed Switch Module

![](/media/2a699e913fa52d9acff4b0e4a8188540.png)

#### **Overview**

In this kit, there is a Keyestudio reed switch module, which mainly uses a MKA10110 green reed component. 

The reed switch is the abbreviation of the dry reed switch. It is a passive electronic switch element with contacts.  

It has the advantages of simple structure, small size and easy control.

Its shell is a sealed glass tube with two iron elastic reed electric plates.

In the experiment, we will determine whether there is a magnetic field near the module by reading the high and low level of the S terminal on the module; and, we display the test result in the shell.

**Working Principle**

Reed switch is an abbreviation of the dry reed contacts a passive electronic switching elements, and has the advantages of simple structure, small size and ease of control, its shell is a sealed glass tube, the tubes are installed two iron elastic reed plate, but also filling called rhodium metal inert gas. In peacetime, the glass tube in the two reeds made of special materials are separated. 

When a magnetic substance close to the glass tube, in the role of the magnetic field lines, the pipe within the two reeds are magnetized to attract each other in contact, the reed will suck together, so that the junction point of the connected circuit communication. After the disappearance of the outer magnetic reed because of their flexibility and separate, the line is disconnected. Therefore, as a use of the magnetic field signals to control the line switching device, reed tube can be used as a sensor for counting the number, spacing, etc., and also are widely used in a variety of communication devices.

### Project 13: PIR Motion Sensor

![](/media/d58ba7b9b4a0115b07cbb1c871ef8ec9.jpeg)

#### **Overview**

In this kit, there is a Keyestudio PIR motion sensor, which mainly uses an RE200B-P sensor elements. It is a human body pyroelectric motion sensor based on pyroelectric effect, which can detect infrared rays emitted by humans or animals, and the Fresnel lens can make the sensor's detection range farther and wider.

In the experiment, we determine if there is someone moving nearby by reading the high and low levels of the S terminal on the module. The detected results will be displayed on the Shell.

#### **Working Principle**

The upper left part is voltage conversion(VCC to 3.3V). The working voltage of sensors we use is 3.3V, therefore we can’t use 5V directly. The voltage conversion circuit is needed.

When no person is detected or no infrared signal is received, and pin 1 of the sensor outputs low level. At this time, the LED on the module will light up and the MOS tube Q1 will be connected and the signal terminal S will detect Low levels.

When one is detected or an infrared signal is received, and pin 1 of the sensor outputs a high level. Then LED on the module will go off, the MOS tube Q1 is disconnected and the signal terminal S will detect high levels.

### Project 14: Active Buzzer

![](/media/f4cc23dc8ed28d408e5a119855e19aa2.jpeg)

#### **Overview**

In this kit, it contains an active buzzer module and a power amplifier module (the principle is equivalent to a passive buzzer). In this experiment, we control the active buzzer to emit sounds. Since it has its own oscillating circuit, the buzzer will automatically sound if given large voltage.

#### **Working Principle**

![](/media/458b66a2a23d6e135e7cf9975fe27507.png)

From the schematic diagram, the pin of buzzer is connected to a resistor R2 and another port is linked with a NPN triode Q1. So, if this triode Q1 is powered, the buzzer will sound.

 

If the base electrode of the triode connected to the R1 resistor is a high level, the triode Q1 will be connected.If the base electrode is pulled down by the resistor R3, the triode is disconnected. 

When we output a high level from the IO port to the triode, the buzzer will emit sounds; if outputting low levels, the buzzer won’t emit sounds.

### Project 15: 8002b Audio Power Amplifier

![](/media/6e8569df97b72e866488a6f414f9e392.jpeg)

#### **Overview**

In this kit, there is a Keyestudio 8002b audio power amplifier. The main components of this module are an adjustable potentiometer, a speaker, and an audio amplifier chip;

The main function of this module is: it can amplify the output audio signal, with a magnification of 8.5 times, and play sound or music through the built-in low-power speaker, as an external amplifying device for some music playing equipment.

In the experiment, we used the 8002b power amplifier speaker module to emit sounds of various frequencies. 

#### **Working Principle**

In fact, it is similar to a passive buzzer. The active buzzer has its own oscillation source. Yet, the passive buzzer does not have internal oscillation. When controlling the circuit, we need to input square waves of different frequencies to the positive pole of the component and ground the negative pole to control the buzzer to chime sounds of different frequencies.

#### **Code Explanation**

In this experiment, we use the PWM class of the machine module, buzzer = PWM(Pin(21)) to create an instance of the PWM class, and the buzzer pin is connected to GP21.

The buzzer.duty\_u16(1000): set the duty cycle, and the duty cycle is 1000/65535. The larger the value, the louder the buzzer. When set to 0, the buzzer does not emit sound. **buzzer.freq()** is the frequency setting method.

In the experiment, we use the PWM on the machine module. **buzzer = PWM(Pin(21))**

#### **Test Result**

Upload the test code successfully and power on. The power amplifier module will emit the sound of the corresponding frequency corresponding to the beat:

DO for 0.5s, Re for 0.5s, Mi for 0.5s, Fa for 0.5s, So for 0.5s, La 0.5s and Si for 0.5s

### Project 16: 130 Motor

![](/media/6c4e0d18c7c1867e27c0bac8e1c6412b.jpeg)

#### **Description**

The 130 motor driver module is compatible with servo motors, which has high efficiency and good quality fans. 

It adopts a HR1124S motor control chip. HR1124S is a single-channel H-bridge driver chip for DC motor solutions. In addition, this chip has low standby current and low quiescent current.

 The module is compatible with various single-chip control boards. In the experiment, we can control the rotation direction of the motor by outputting the voltage directions of the two signal terminals IN+ and IN- to make the motor rotate. 

#### **Working Principle**

The chip is used to help drive the motor. 

We can’t drive it with a triode or an IO port due to its a large current of need. It is very simple to make the motor rotate. Just apply voltage to both ends of the motor. The direction of the motor is different in different voltage directions. Within the rated voltage, the higher the voltage, the faster the motor rotates; on the contrary, the lower the voltage, the slower the motor rotates, or even unable to rotate. 

So we can use the PWM port to control the speed of the motor. We haven't learned PWM here, so we use the high and low levels to control the motor first.

### Project 17: RGB Module

![](/media/b3515a7e0340f391bef256c9ed6ccd4b.jpeg)

#### **Overview**

Among these modules is a RGB module. It adopts a F10-full color RGB foggy common cathode LED. We connect the RGB module to the PWM port of MCU and the other pin to GND(for common anode RGB, the rest pin will be connected to VCC). So what is PWM?

PWM is a means of controlling the analog output via digital means. Digital control is used to generate square waves with different duty cycles (a signal that constantly switches between high and low levels) to control the analog output.In general, the input voltages of ports are 0V and 5V. What if the 3V is required? Or a switch among 1V, 3V and 3.5V? We cannot change resistors constantly. For this reason, we resort to PWM. 

![](/media/bbcfcb9ae56abb7e80ee587246fc4be9.GIF)

For Arduino digital port voltage outputs, there are only LOW and HIGH levels, which correspond to the voltage outputs of 0V and 5V respectively. You can define LOW as“0”and HIGH as“1’, and let the Arduino output five hundred‘0’or“1”within 1 second. If output five hundred‘1’, that is 5V; if all of which is‘0’,that is 0V; if output 250 01 pattern, that is 2.5V. 

This process can be likened to showing a movie. The movie we watch are not completely continuous. Actually, it generates 25 pictures per second, which cannot be told by human eyes. Therefore, we mistake it as a continuous process. PWM works in the same way. To output different voltages, we need to control the ratio of 0 and 1. The more‘0’or‘1’ output per unit time, the more accurate the control.

#### **Working Principle**

For our experiment, we will control the RGB module to display different colors through three PWM values.

#### **Explanation**

**Code 1：**

In the code 1, red, green and blue represent the red, green and blue ports. According to the wiring diagram, we have connected to GP9, GP10 and GP11,then set to 9, 10 and 11.Use the function **.value(1)** to set three LEDs.If the corresponding digital port is high level, and the corresponding LED will be on 

The RGB module displays red color for 1 second, green color for 1 second, and blue color for 1 second, cycle alternately.

**Code 2：**

In the code 2, we use PWM output, and set **frequency to .freq(1000).duty\_u16()**

The number in the brackets means the proportion of the color of LED. The larger the duty cycle data we set, the larger the proportion of the color. 

**(Note: the duty cycle above we set is maximum to .duty\_u16(65535), this value is 256\*256 - 1, that is 0\~65535. As for the following the RGB color table, you only need to make values below multiply by 256.** 

In the experiment, we adjust the ratio of red, green and blue colors on the RGB LED by setting the corresponding values, so as to control the RGB LED to display corresponding colors. So theoretically, there are 256\*256\*256 colors that can be set (for details, please refer to the common RGB color table below)

#### **Test Result**

Upload the code 1, the RGB on the module will show red, green and blue color with an interval of 1s.

Upload the code 2, the RGB on the module will show red, orange, yellow, green, cyan-blue, blue, purple and white color with an interval of 1s.

### Project 18: Potentiometer

![](/media/fe92a4f36758bc236d94290478fe5eac.jpeg)

#### **Overview**

The following we will introduce is the Keyestudio rotary potentiometer which is an analog sensor.

The digital IO ports can read the voltage value between 0 and 3.3V and the module only outputs high levels. However, the analog sensor can read the voltage value through ADC analog ports(GP26\~GP28) on the pico board.

In the experiment, we will display the test results on the Shell.

![](/media/a6ca9064a864e572984fdc41207eaaca.jpeg)

#### **Working Principle**

It uses a 10K adjustable resistor. We can change the resistance by rotating the potentiometer. The signal S can detect the voltage changes(0-3.3V) which are analog quantity

**Test Code**

```python
'''
 * * Keyestudio 42 in 1 Starter Kit for Raspberry Pi Pico
 * lesson 18
 * Rotary potentiometer
 * http://www.keyestudio.com
'''
import machine
import utime

potentiometer = machine.ADC(26)

while True:
    pot_value = potentiometer.read_u16()
    print(pot_value)
    utime.sleep(0.1)
```

#### **Code Explanation**

**In the experiment, we will create** ADC example, connect GP26 **ADC(26). That means ADC(0).**

**.read\_u16() is used to read analog values, in the range of** 0\~65535.

**potentiometer.read\_u16() means** that reading the analog value of ADC(26) pin then assign it to the variable **pot\_value**

**utime.sleep()** is the delay function which works as same as the function **time.sleep()**

**analogVal** means analog value. The rotary potentiometer outputs analog values(0\~4095), therefore, we set pins to analog ports. For example, we connect to ADC0(GP26)

**analogRead(pin)**: read the value of the specified analog pin. The pico board contains a multi-channel, 12-bit converter. This means that it will map the input voltage between 0 and the working voltage (5V or 3.3V) to an integer value between 0 and 4095. For example, this will produce a resolution among readings: 3.3V/4096 stands for 0.0008V per unit.

Pin: the name of analog input pin. GP26 is connected to GP28, GP29 measures VSYS voltage and ADC4 measures the internal temperature.

#### **Test Result**

Run the test code, observe the analog value in the Shell monitor. In the experiment , run the test code then observe the analog value. Rotate the knob of the potentiometer clockwise to increase the analog value. On the contrary, the analog value will be reduced by rotating the potentiometer anticlockwise. The value is in the range of 0-65535.

Upload the code power up by a USB cable, open the serial monitor and set baud rate to 9600. In the experiment, rotate the potentiometer clockwise, the analog value increases, and turn the potentiometer counterclockwise, the analog value decreases(0-4095), as shown in the figure below.

### Project 19: Steam Sensor

![](/media/0062e47b90828244595c1fb93c45f1d5.jpeg)

#### **Description**

This is a commonly used steam sensor. Its principle is to detect the amount of water by bare printed parallel lines on the circuit board. The more the water is, the more wires will be connected. As the conductive contact area increases, the output voltage will gradually rise. It can detect water vapor in the air as well. The steam sensor can be used as a rain water detector and level switch. When the humidity on the sensor surface surges, the output voltage will increase.

In the experiment, we connect the signal terminal (S terminal) of the sensor to the analog port of the pico development board. The analog value detected will be displayed on the serial monitor.

This is a DIY electronic building block water drop sensor. It is an analog (digital) input module, also called rain, rain sensor. It can be used to monitor various weather conditions, detect whether it is raining and the amount of rain, convert it into digital signal (DO) and analog signal (AO) output, and is widely used in Arduino robot kits, raindrops, rain sensors, and can be used for various It can monitor various weather conditions, and convert it into digital signal and AO output, and can also be used for automobile automatic wiper system, intelligent lighting system and intelligent sunroof system. In the experiment, we input the sensor signal terminal (S terminal) to the analog port of the pico development board, sense the change of the analog value, and display the corresponding analog value on the shell.

Its principle is to detect the amount of water through the exposed printed parallel lines on the circuit board. The more water there is, the more wires will be connected, and the conductive contact area increases. The voltage output by pin 2 will gradually increase. The larger the analog value detected by the signal terminal S is.

It can also detect steam in the air. Two position holes are used to install on the other devices.

### Project 21: Photoresistor

![](/media/37bb57bcf72ba62056bbc61164185f0a.png)

#### **Description**

In this kit, there is a photoresistor which consists of photosensitive resistance elements. Its resistance changes with the light intensity. Also, it converts the resistance change into a voltage change through the characteristic of the photosensitive resistive element. When wiring it up, we interface its signal terminal (S terminal) with the analog port of pico , so as to sense the change of the analog value, and display the corresponding analog value in the shell.

#### **Working Principle**

If there is no light, the resistance is 0.2MΩ and the detected voltage at the terminal 2 is close to 0. When the light intensity increases, the resistance of photoresistor and detected voltage will diminish.

### Project 22: NTC-MF52AT Thermistor

![](/media/868d93395d983645baab872091991403.jpeg)

#### **Overview**

In the experiment, there is a NTC-MF52AT analog thermistor. We connect its signal terminal to the analog port of the Raspberry Pi Pico Board and read the corresponding analog value.

We can use analog values to calculate the temperature of the current environment through specific formulas. Since the temperature calculation formula is more complicated, we only read the corresponding analog value.

#### **Working Principle**

![](/media/84a67bb2b90b4740c09d914dc6402f48.png)

This module mainly uses NTC-MF52AT thermistor elements. The NTC-MF52AT thermistor element can sense the changes of the surrounding environment temperature. Resistance changes with the temperature, causing the voltage of the signal terminal S to change. This sensor uses the characteristics of NTC-MF52AT thermistor element to convert resistance changes into voltage changes.

### Project 23: Thin-film Pressure Sensor

![](/media/a9ae2963fc87b3502703f7dd5eb208ec.jpeg)

#### **Overview**

In this kit, there is a Keyestudio thin-film pressure sensor. The thin-film pressure sensor composed of a new type of nano pressure-sensitive material and a comfortable ultra-thin film substrate, has waterproof and pressure-sensitive functions.

In the experiment, we determine the pressure by collecting the analog signal on the S end of the module. The smaller the analog value, the greater the pressure; and the displayed results will shown on the Shell.

#### **Working Principle**

When the sensor is pressed by external forces, the resistance value of sensor will vary. We convert the pressure signals detected by the sensor into the electric signals through a circuit. Then we can obtain the pressure changes by detecting voltage signal changes.

### Project 24: Flame Sensor

![](/media/c6c3bf0c9bf0af22a2aa06c5b7399cfd.jpeg)

#### **Description**

In daily life, it is often seen that a fire broke out without any precaution. It will cause great economic and human loss. So how can we avoid this situation? Right, install a flame sensor and a speaker in those places that easily break out a fire. When the flame sensor detects a fire, the speaker will alarm people quickly to put out the fire.

So in this project, you will learn how to use a flame sensor and an active buzzer module to simulate the fire alarm system.

#### **Working Principle**

This flame sensor can be used to detect fire or other light sources with wavelength stands at 760nm \~ 1100nm. Its detection angle is about 60°. You can rotate the potentiometer on the sensor to control its sensitivity. Adjust the potentiometer to make the LED at the critical point between on and off state. The sensitivity is the best.

From the below figure, power up. When detecting fire, the digital pin outputs low levels, the red LED2 will light up first, the digital signal terminal D0 outputs a low level, and the red LED1 will light up. The stronger the external infrared light, the smaller the value; the weaker the infrared light, the larger the value.

### Project 25: MQ-2 Gas Sensor

![](/media/f712788d3997805df25abe4a99d42461.GIF)

#### **Description**

This analog gas sensor - MQ2 is used in gas leakage detecting equipment in consumer electronics and industrial markets.

This sensor is suitable for detecting LPG, I-butane, propane, methane, alcohol, Hydrogen and smoke. It has high sensitivity and quick response.

In addition, the sensitivity can be adjusted by rotating the potentiometer.

In the experiment, we read the analog value at the A0 port and the D0 port to determine the content of gas.

#### **Working Principle**

![](/media/c55edbe71237172f6b80877504a9debb.png)

The greater the concentration of smoke, the greater the conductivity, the lower the output resistance, the greater the output analog signal. 

When in use, the A0 terminal reads the analog value of the corresponding gas; the D0 terminal is connected to an LM393 chip (voltage comparator), we can adjust the alarm threshold of the measured gas through the potentiometer, and output the digital value at D0. When the measured gas content exceeds the critical point, the D0 terminal outputs a low level; when the measured gas content does not exceed the critical point, the D0 terminal outputs a high level.

#### **Test Result**

Run the test code, the yellow-green LED on the module lights up, observe the shell, and display the corresponding data and characters. 

In the experiment, we can see that when the simulated value of the test is less than or equal to 45627, the gas content does not exceed the critical point, and the red LED is off; when the simulated value of the test is greater than or equal to 45627, the gas content exceeds the critical point, and the red LED lights up. Then it means that the analog value of the critical point of gas content is between 43018-45627, we can adjust the critical point by rotating the potentiometer on the sensor.

### Project 26: MQ-3 Alcohol Sensor

#### **Description**

In this kit, there is a MQ-3 alcohol sensor, which uses the gas-sensing material is tin dioxide (SnO2) which has a low conductivity in clean air. When there is alcohol vapor in the environment where the sensor is located, the conductivity of the sensor increases with the increase of the alcohol gas concentration in the air. The change in conductivity can be converted into an output signal corresponding to the gas concentration using a simple circuit.

In the experiment, we read the analog value at the A0 end of the sensor and the digital value at the D0 end to judge the content of alcohol vapor in the air and whether they exceed the standard.

#### **Working Principle**

![](/media/2eea6cee3a030f8e70ad781e1e25e45e.png)

At a certain temperature, the conductivity changes with the composition of the ambient gas. When in use, A0 terminal reads the analog value corresponding to alcohol vapor; D0 terminal is connected to an LM393 chip (comparator), we can adjust and measure the alcohol vapor alarm threshold through the potentiometer, and output the digital value at D0. When the measured alcohol vapor content exceeds the critical point, the D0 terminal outputs a low level; when the measured alcohol vapor content does not exceed the critical point, the D0 terminal outputs a high level.

        print("Exceeding")
    else:
        print("Normal")
    utime.sleep(0.1)
```

#### **Test Result**

Run the test code, the red LED on the module lights up, and the shell displays the corresponding data and characters. In the experiment, when the tested simulated value is less than or equal to 45387, the gas content does not exceed the critical point, and the yellow-green LED will be off; when the tested simulated value is greater than or equal to 45419, the gas content exceeds the critical point, and the yellow-green LED will light up; That means the critical point is in the range of 45387-45419. We can adjust the critical point by rotating the potentiometer on the sensor.

### Project 27: Five-key AD Button Module

![](/media/65bcbbacb5ea3944b61878440076dd79.png)

#### **Description**

When we talked about analog and digital sensors earlier, we talked about the single-channel key module. When we press the key, it outputs a low level, and when we release the key, it outputs a high level. We can only read these two digital signals. In fact, the key module ADC acquisition can also be performed. In this kit, a DIY electronic building block five-way AD button module is included.

We can judge which key is pressed through the analog value. In the experiment, we print out the key press information in the shell.

#### **Working Principle**

Let’s look at the schematic diagram, when we do not press the key, the OUT of S output to the signal end is pulled down by R1. At this time, we read the low level 0V. When we press the key SW1, the OUT of the output to the signal end S is directly connected to the VCC. At this time, we read the high level 3.3V(the figure is marked as a 10-bit ADC(0~1023) and VCC is 5V. The principle is the same. Here we have VCC of 3.3V and ADC mapped to 16 bits), which is an analog value of 65535.

Next,when we press the key SW2, the OUT terminal voltage of the signal we read is the voltage between R2 and R1, namely VCC*R1/(R2+R1), which is about 2.64V, and the analog value is about 52219. 

When we press the key SW3, the OUT terminal voltage of the signal we read is the voltage between R2+R3 and R1, namely VCC*R1/(R3+R2+R1), which is about 1.99V, and the analog value is about 39360. 

When we press the key SW4, the OUT terminal voltage of the signal we read is the voltage between R2+R3+R4 and R1, namely VCC*R1/(R4+R3+R2+R1), about 1.31V, and the analog value is about 26109.

Similarly, when we press the key SW5, the OUT terminal voltage of the signal we read is the voltage between R2+R3+R4+R5 and R1, namely VCC*R1/(R5+R4+R3+R2+R1), which is about 0.68V, and the analog value is about 13415.

#### **Test Code**

```python
'''
 * Keyestudio 42 in 1 Starter Kit for Raspberry Pi Pico
 * lesson 27
 * AD key
 * http://www.keyestudio.com
'''
import machine
import utime

ad_key = machine.ADC(26)

while True:
    value = ad_key.read_u16()
    print(value, end = '')
    if value <= 6000:
        print("  no key  is pressed")
    elif value <= 20000:

    elif value <= 32000:
        print("  SW4 is pressed")
    elif value <= 45000:
        print("  SW3 is pressed")
    elif value <= 59000:
        print("  SW2 is pressed")
    else:
        print("  SW1 is pressed")
    utime.sleep(0.1)
```

#### **Code Explanation**

We assign the read analog value to the variable val, and the shell displays the value of val, (our default setting is 9600, which can be changed). 

We judge the read analog value. When the analog value is lower than 6000, we judge that the button is not pressed; when the analog value is between 6000 and 20000, we judge that the button SW5 is pressed; Between 20000 and 32000, we judge that the button SW4 is pressed; when the analog value is between 32000 and 45000, we judge that the button SW3 is pressed; when the analog value is between 45000 and 59000, we judge that the button SW2 is pressed. Press; otherwise, when the analog value is above 59000, we judge that the button SW1 is pressed; if we only use a fixed value, there will inevitably be errors, so we use the interval to judge.

#### **Test Result**

After uploading the test code successfully, when the button is pressed, the shell prints out the corresponding information, as shown in the figure below.

### Project 28: Joystick Module

![](/media/a28a09d0d9103cc8b93f2ae71f98482a.jpeg)

#### **Overview**

Game handle controllers are ubiquitous.

It mainly uses PS2 joysticks. When controlling it, we need to connect the X and Y ports of the module to the analog port of the single-chip microcomputer, port B to the digital port of the single-chip microcomputer, VCC to the power output port(3.3-5V), and GND to the GND of the MCU. We can read the high and low levels of two analog values and one digital port) to determine the working status of the joystick on the module.

In the experiment, two analog values(x axis and y axis) will be shown on Shell.

#### **Working Principle**

![](/media/efcb8ed421ab3572af890d73788a8c01.jpeg)

In fact, its working principle is very simple. Its inside structure is equivalent to two adjustable potentiometers and a button. When this button is not pressed and the module is pulled down by R1, low levels will be output ; on the contrary, when the button is pressed, VCC will be connected (high levels), When we move the joystick, the internal potentiometer will adjust to output different voltages, and we can read the analog value.

### Project 29: Ultraviolet Sensor

![](/media/73df098dc8f87602650d64810bacad7a.png)

#### **Description**

There is a ultraviolet Sensor used for UV index monitoring, UV radiation dose measurement, flame detection. Suitable for measuring UV index of smart wearable devices, such as UV index detection of watches, smart phones and outdoor equipment. It can also be used to monitor the intensity of UV light, or as a UV flame detector when UV sanitizing items. The sensor has a specific spectral response. In the experiment, we use the purple led module to test the UV module, and then display the results on the shell.

#### **Working Principle**

The output current of the UV sensor is proportional to the light intensity, and the output of the product has a very high consistency. The module circuit has been set up, and we directly use the ADC to collect the analog signal.

### Project 30: SK6812 RGB Module

![](/media/effda831f7c06cea2c443d8352f1a693.jpeg)

#### **Overview**

In previous lessons, we learned about the plug-in RGB module and used PWM signals to color the three pins of the module. 

There is a Keyestudio 6812 RGB module whose the driving principle is different from the plug-in RGB module. It can only control with one pin. This is a set. It is an intelligent externally controlled LED light source with the control circuit and the light-emitting circuit. Each LED element is the same as a 5050 LED lamp bead, and each component is a pixel. There are four lamp beads on the module, which indicates four pixels.

In the experiment, we make different lights show different colors. 

#### **Working Principle**

From the schematic diagram, we can see that these four pixel lighting beads are all connected in series. In fact, no matter how many they are, we can use a pin to control a light and let it display any color. The pixel point contains a data latch signal shaping amplifier drive circuit, a high-precision internal oscillator and a 12V high-voltage programmable constant current control part, which effectively ensures the color of the pixel point light is highly consistent.

The data protocol adopts a single-wire zero-code communication method. After the pixel is powered up and reset, the S terminal receives the data transmitted from the controller. The first 24bit data sent is extracted by the first pixel and sent to the data latch of the pixel.

#### **Code Explanation**

A few function ports and functions:

**NUM\_LEDS = 4**, there are four LED beads, so we set to 4.

**PIN\_NUM = 16**, this is the pin number, we connect to GP16

**brightness = 0.1**, brightness setting. 1 implies brightest

**pixels\_show()**，this function is used to refresh

**pixels\_set(i, color)**，this function is used to set locations and color of LED beads.

**pixels\_fill(color)**，display **colors of LED beads**

#### **Test Result**

Run the test code, wire up and power up. Then we can see four LED beads show red, green, blue and white color; as shown below.

### Project 31: Rotary Encoder

![](/media/ec37b336b8f5620b62b04224b132840a.jpeg)

#### **Overview**

In this kit, there is a Keyestudio rotary encoder, dubbed as switch encoder. It is applied to automotive electronics, multimedia audio, instrumentation, household appliances, smart home, medical equipment and so on.

In the experiment, it it used for counting. When we rotate the rotary encoder clockwise, the set data falls by 1; if you rotate it anticlockwise, the set data is up 1; and when the middle button is pressed, the value will be show on Shell.

#### **Working Principle**

![](/media/2fb56ec6fa69e66fcca4243617d4b18c.jpeg)

The incremental encoder converts the displacement into a periodic electric signal, and then converts this signal into a counting pulse, and the number of pulses indicates the size of the displacement.

This module mainly uses 20-pulse rotary encoder components. It can calculate the number of pulses output during clockwise and reverse rotation. There is no limit to count rotation. It resets to the initial state, that is, starts counting from 0.

```

#### **Code Explanation**

In the experiment, we need to add the rotary encoder to pico, then import the module.

You only need to save the .py file to pico

1.  After adding the rotary encoder, click **File**
    
    ![](/media/54429862146da827b2cc0a3837069a7c.png)

2.  We will see the file rotary.py and rotary\_irq\_rp2.py. This means the we save them in the pico successfully. Then we can use **from rotary\_irq\_rp2 import RotaryIRQ.**
    
3.  **SW=Pin(20,Pin.IN,Pin.PULL\_UP)** indicates that the SW pin is connected to GP20, **pin\_num\_clk=18** indicates that the pin CLK is connected to GP18, and **pin\_num\_dt=19** means that the DT pin is connected to GP19. We can change these pin numbers.
    
4.  **try/except** is the python language exception capture processing statement, **try** executes the code, **except** executes the code when an exception occurs, and when we press Ctrl+C, the program exits.
    
5. **r.value()** returns the value of the encoder.

#### **Test Result**

Run the test code, observe the Shell below. Rotate the encoder clockwise, the displayed data decrease; rotate the encoder counterclockwise, the displayed data increase; press the button of the encoder, the displayed data is the value of the encoder, as shown in the figure below.

### Project 32: Servo Control

![](/media/165f16e47a832fc4dcaea6e4a1c11194.jpeg)

#### **Overview**

Servo motor is a position control rotary actuator. It mainly consists of a housing, a circuit board, a core-less motor, a gear and a position sensor. Its working principle is that the servo receives the signal sent by MCU or receiver and produces a reference signal with a period of 20ms and width of 1.5ms, then compares the acquired DC bias voltage to the voltage of the potentiometer and obtain the voltage difference output.

In general, servo has three lines in brown, red and orange. The brown wire is grounded, the red one is a positive pole line and the orange one is a signal line.

#### **Working Principle**

![image-20230529120851772](media/image-20230529120851772.png)

![](media/3366fe332bcf286659f9bf21a8cf880f-16853334173136.png)

When the motor speed is constant, the potentiometer is driven to rotate through the cascade reduction gear, which leads that the voltage difference is 0, and the motor stops rotating. Generally, the angle range of servo rotation is 0° --180 °.

The rotation angle of servo motor is controlled by regulating the duty cycle of PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) signal. The standard cycle of PWM signal is 20ms (50Hz). Theoretically, the width is distributed between 1ms-2ms, but in fact, it's between 0.5ms-2.5ms. The width corresponds the rotation angle from 0° to 180°. But note that for different brand motors, the same signal may have different rotation angles.

        setServoCycle(pos)
```

#### **Code Explanation**

**Code 1：**

According to the angle of the signal pulse width, it is converted into a duty cycle. The formula is: 2.5+angle/180\*10. The PWM pin resolution of Pi Pico is 2^16 = 65535. When converted to 0 degree, its duty cycle is 65535 \* 2.5% = 1638.375 , when the angle is 180 degrees, its duty cycle value is 65535 \* 12.5% = 8191.875, these two values will be related to the program, considering the error and rotation angle, I set the duty cycle at 1000 Between 9000 and 9000, the servo can rotate smoothly 0\~180 degrees.

**Code 2：**

**convert(x, i\_m, i\_M, o\_m, o\_M)**: x is the value we want to map; **i\_m, i\_M** are the lower and upper limits of the current value; o\_m, o\_M are the lower and upper limits of the target range we want to map to.

#### **Test Result**

**Result 1：**

Run the test code successfully, the servo rotates cyclically from 0 degrees, 90 degrees, and 180 degrees.

**Test Result 2：**

Run the test code successfully, the servo rotates back and forth from 0 to 180 degrees, one degree every 10ms.

### Project 33: Ultrasonic Sensor

#### **Overview**

In this kit, there is a keyes HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, which can detect obstacles in front and the detailed distance between the sensor and the obstacle. Its principle is the same as that of bat flying. It can emit the ultrasonic signals that cannot be heard by humans. When these signals hit an obstacle and come back immediately. The distance between the sensor and the obstacle can be calculated by the time gap of emitting signals and receiving signals.

In the experiment, we use the sensor to detect the distance between the sensor and the obstacle, and print the test result.

Ultrasonic detector module can provide 2cm-450cm non-contact sensing distance, and its ranging accuracy is up to 3mm, very good to meet the normal requirements. The module includes an ultrasonic transmitter and receiver as well as the corresponding control circuit.

#### **Working Principle**

The most common ultrasonic ranging method is the echo detection. As shown below; when the ultrasonic emitter emits the ultrasonic waves towards certain direction, the counter will count. The ultrasonic waves travel and reflect back once encountering the obstacle. Then the counter will stop counting when the receiver receives the ultrasonic waves coming back.

The ultrasonic wave is also sound wave, and its speed of sound V is related to temperature. Generally, it travels 340m/s in the air. According to time t, we can calculate the distance s from the emitting spot to the obstacle. 
$$
s=340t/2
$$
The HC-SR04 ultrasonic ranging module can provide a non-contact distance sensing function of 2cm-400cm, and the ranging accuracy can reach as high as 3mm; the module includes an ultrasonic transmitter, receiver and control circuit. Basic working principle:

1\. First pull down the TRIG, and then trigger it with at least 10us high level signal;

2\. After triggering, the module will automatically transmit eight 40KHZ square waves, and automatically detect whether there is a signal to return.

3\. If there is a signal returned back, through the ECHO to output a high level, the duration time of high level is actually the time from emission to reception of ultrasonic.
$$
Test Distance = High Level Duration * 340m/s * 0.5
$$

### Project 34: IR Receiver Module

![](/media/80e8f8d8ddc35df9425032ec4ef783ee.png)

#### **Overview**

There is no doubt that infrared remote control is ubiquitous in daily life. It is used to control various household appliances, such as TVs, stereos, video recorders and satellite signal receivers. Infrared remote control is composed of infrared transmitting and infrared receiving systems, that is, an infrared remote control and infrared receiving module and a single-chip microcomputer capable of decoding.   

In this experiment, we need to know how to use the infrared receiving sensor. The infrared receiving sensor mainly uses the VS1838B infrared receiving sensor element. It integrates receiving, amplifying, and demodulating. The internal IC has already completed the demodulation, and the output is a digital signal. It can receive 38KHz modulated remote control signal. In the experiment, we use the IR receiver to receive the infrared signal emitted by the external infrared transmitting device, and display the received signal in the shell.

#### **Working Principle**

![](/media/845973091e7fe407e7fa0e96fc1cf4f1.png)

The main part of the IR remote control system is modulation, transmission and reception. The modulated carrier frequency is generally between 30khz and 60khz, and most of them use a square wave of 38kHz and a duty ratio of 1/3. A 4.7K pull-up resistor R3 is added to the signal end of the infrared receiver.

### Project 35: DS18B20 Temperature Sensor

![](/media/29c66f83d6ea8bbc378b0508e78d5f3b.png)

#### **Description**

The DS18B20 is a 1-wire programmable Temperature sensor from maxim integrated. It is widely used to measure temperature in hard environments like in chemical solutions, mines or soil etc. The constriction of the sensor is rugged and also can be purchased with a waterproof option making the mounting process easy. It can measure a wide range of temperature from **-55°C to +125°** with a decent accuracy of **±5°C**. Each sensor has a unique address and requires only one pin of the MCU to transfer data so it a very good choice for measuring temperature at multiple points without compromising much of your digital pins on the microcontroller.

#### **Working Principle**

![](/media/eef2d84a2ad003d15575726341de52bf.png)

The hardware interface of the 1-Wire bus is very simple, just connect the data pin of the DS18B20 to an IO port of the microcontroller. The timing of the 1-Wire bus is relatively complex. Many students can’t understand the timing diagram independently here. We have encapsulated the complex timing operations in the library, and you can use the library functions directly.

**Schematic Diagram of DS18B20**

This can save up to 12-bit temperature vale. In the register, save in code complement. As shown below;

![](/media/bffba8c519ff6e0310882d0712be9177.png)

A total of 2 bytes, LSB is the low byte, MSB is the high byte, where MSb is the high byte of the byte, LSb is the low byte of the byte. As you can see, the binary number, the meaning of the temperature represented by each bit, is expressed. Among them, S represents the sign bit, and the lower 11 bits are all powers of 2, which are used to represent the final temperature. The temperature measurement range of DS18B20 is from -55 degrees to +125 degrees, and the expression form of temperature data, S represents positive and negative temperature, and the resolution is 2﹣⒋, which is 0.0625.

### Project 38: ADXL345 Acceleration Sensor

#### Description

![](/media/5f742d0fc3fb996a9b3ab6c0fcabca6b.png)

In this kit, there is a DIY electronic building block ADXL345 acceleration sensor module, which uses the ADXL345BCCZ chip. The chip is a small, thin, low-power 3-axis accelerometer with a high resolution (13 bits) and a measurement range of ±16g that can measure both dynamic acceleration due to motion or impact as well as stationary acceleration such as gravitational acceleration, making the device usable as a tilt sensor.  

In the study, we test the acceleration value of sensor X, Y and Z axis.  What’s more, we show the test data in the shell.

#### **Working Principle**

![](/media/e65ba145d12cb99426897047f86dddc3.jpeg)

The ADXL345 is a complete 3-axis acceleration measurement system with a selection of measurement ranges of ±2 g, ±4 g, ±8 g or ±16 g. Its digital output data is in 16-bit binary complement format and can be accessed through an SPI (3-wire or 4-wire) or I2C digital interface. 

The sensor can measure static acceleration due to gravity in tilt detection applications, as well as dynamic acceleration due to motion or impact. Its high resolution (3.9mg/LSB) enables measurement of tilt Angle changes of less than 1.0°.

### Project 39: TM1650 4-Digit Tube Display

![](/media/f698ea56391906278b7c8064fca42bb3.jpeg)

#### **Overview**

This module is mainly composed of a 0.36 inch red common anode 4-digit digital tube, and its driver chip is TM1650. When using it, we only need two signal lines to make the single-chip microcomputer control a 4-bitdigit tube, which greatly saves the IO port resources of the control board.

TM1650 is a special circuit for LED (light emitting diode display) drive control. It integrates MCU input and output control digital interface, data latch, LED drivers, keyboard scanning, brightness adjustment and other circuits.

TM1650 has stable performance, reliable quality and strong anti-interference ability. 

It can be applied to the application of long-term continuous working for 24 hours. 

TM1650 uses 2-wire serial transmission protocol for communication (note that this data transmission protocol is not a standard I2C protocol). The chip can drive the digital tube and save MCU pin resources through two pins and MCU communication.

#### **Working Principle**

TM1650 adopts IIC treaty and SDA and SCL wire.

Data command setting is 0x48. This means that lighting up the tube display not perform its button scanning function.

**Command display setting:**

bit\[6:4\]：set the brightness of tube display, and 000 is brightest

bit\[3\]：set to show decimal points

bit\[0\]：start the display of the tube display

#### **Code Explanation**

1\. **clkPin = 15**; **dioPin = 14** is pin number. CLK is connected to GP15，DIO is connected to GOP14. We can set any pin at random.

2\. **displayBit(bit, num):** show numbers at bit(1\~4) bit num(0\~9)

3\. **clearBit(bit): clear up** bit(1\~4)

4\. **setBrightness()**: brightness setting

5\. **displayOnOFF()** 0 means OFF, 1 means ON

6\. **displayDot(bit, OnOff)** shows dots，0 means OFF, 1 means ON

7\. **ShowNum(num)**: show integer num，in the range of 0\~9999

#### **Test Result**

Run the test code, wire up and power on. The 4-digit tube display will show integer from 0 to 99999, an increase of 1 for each 10ms, then start from 0 once reaching 99999.

### Project 40: HT16K33\_8X8 Dot Matrix Module

![](/media/431b6c4abd63b99219658a03d24de991.jpeg)

#### **Overview**

What is the dot matrix display?

The 8X8 dot matrix is composed of 64 light-emitting diodes, and each light-emitting diode is placed at the intersection of the row line and the column line. When the corresponding row is set to 1 level, and a certain column is set to 0 level, the corresponding diode  will light up.

#### **Working Principle**

As the schematic diagram shown, to light up the LED at the first row and column, we only need to set C1 to high level and R1 to low level. To turn on LEDs at the first row, we set R1 to low level and C1-C8 to high level.

16 IO ports are needed, which will highly waste the MCU resources.

Therefore, we designed this module, using the HT16K33 chip to drive an 8*8 dot matrix, which greatly saves the resources of the single-chip microcomputer.

There are three DIP switches on the module, all of which are set to I2C communication address. The setting method is shown below.

A0，A1and A2 are grounded, that is, the address is 0x70.

#### **Code Explanation**

**show\_char():** displayed characters, for instance show\_char(matrix\_fonts.textFont1\['A'\]) shows A

**scroll\_message(font,message='hello',delay=0.05)**: scroll to display, 0.05 is the speed of the scroll, massage is character string and font is module file.

#### **Test Result**

Wire up and run the test code. The dot matrix displays "A" for one second, "B" for one second, "C" for one second, and then scroll to display the "Hello World" pattern.

### Project 41: LCD\_128X32\_DOT Module

#### Description

![](/media/a250a2acca97ec608626e66c00a77e68.jpeg)

This is a 128*32 pixel LCD module, which uses IIC communication mode and  ST7567A driver chip . At the same time, the code contains all the English letters and common symbols of the library that can be directly called. When used, we can also set English letters and symbols to display different text sizes in our code. To make it easy to set up the pattern display, we also provide a mold capture software that can convert a specific pattern into control code and then copy it directly into the test code for use. 

In the experiment, we will set up the display screen to display various English words, common symbols and numbers.

### Project 42: RFID Module

![](/media/75003b61112e3495f213629e49f26185.jpeg)

#### **Description**

RFIDRFID-RC522 radio frequency module adopts a Philips MFRC522 original chip to design card reading circuit, easy to use and low cost, suitable for equipment development and card reader development and so on.

RFID or Radio Frequency Identification system consists of two main components, a transponder/tag attached to an object to be identified, and a Transceiver also known as interrogator/Reader.

In the experiment, the data read by the card swipe module is 4 hexadecimal numbers, and we print these four hexadecimal numbers as strings. For example, we read the data of the IC card below: 0x8d, 0xfe, 0x6c, 0x4d, and the information string displayed in the shell is 8dfe6c4d; the data read from the keychain is: 0xbc, 0x33, 0x76, 0x6e, and the information is displayed in the shell The string is bc33766e. 

#### **Working Principle**

RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)

Radio frequency identification, the card reader is composed of a radio frequency module and a high-level magnetic field. The Tag transponder is a sensing device, and this device does not contain a battery. It only contains tiny integrated circuit chips and media for storing data and antennas for receiving and transmitting signals. To read the data in the tag, first put it into the reading range of the card reader. The reader will generate a magnetic field, and because the magnetic energy generates electricity according to Lenz's law, the RFID tag will supply power, thereby activating the device.

#### **Code Explanation**

First import the module of RFID522:

![](/media/fb8bd27e4aa4cb193d6db899ed41fbf3.png)

**mfrc522\_config.py**; this is a configuration file that defines some parameters and commands

**mfrc522\_i2c.py;** Initialization and read and write functions

**Soft\_iic.py;** It is the bottom-level read and write function of software I2C. We use the io port to simulate I2C here.

#### **Test Result**

When we make the IC card close to the RFID module, the information will be printed out, as shown in the figure below.

## Comprehensive Experiments

The previous projects are related to single sensor or module. In the following part, we will combine various sensors and modules to create some comprehensive experiments to perform special functions.

### Project 43: Breathing LED

![](/media/25107e92a36e701f271b2371359f2679.jpeg)

#### **Overview**

A “breathing LED” is a phenomenon where an LED's brightness smoothly changes from dark to bright and back to dark, continuing to do so and giving the illusion of an LED“breathing. This phenomenon is similar to a lung breathing in and out. So how to control LED’s brightness? We need to take advantage of PWM.

#### **Run the test code**

Double-click **Breath.py**, and click![](/media/d1dbbae869194ef12c2d684636f1ce4b.png)to run the code.

![](/media/497f094136906d023b05f5466604ad64.png)

**Test Code**

```python
'''
 * * Keyestudio 42 in 1 Starter Kit for Raspberry Pi Pico
 * lesson 43
 * Breath
 * http://www.keyestudio.com
'''
import machine
import time

pwm = machine.PWM(machine.Pin(15))
pwm.freq(1000)

duty = 0
direction = 1
while True:
    duty += direction
    if duty > 255:
        duty = 255
        direction = -1
    elif duty < 0:
        duty = 0
        direction = 1
    pwm.duty_u16(duty * duty)
    time.sleep(0.01)
```

#### **Code Explanation**

The larger the set duty cycle, the brighter the LED will be, with a maximum of 65535. The duty increases from 0 to 255 at the beginning, with an increase of 1, and delay in 10 milliseconds for each time, the LED on the module will gradually become brighter.

After PWM is 255*255, i starts to decrease from 255 to 0, decreasing by 1 each time, and delaying 10 milliseconds each time, the LED on the module gradually gets dark. Then it gradually becomes brighter, cycle alternately, just like the human breathes.

We can change the delayed time in the code. There are two ways: 

Change the step length or reduce the delayed time.

The step length is supposed to divided by 255, for instance direction = -2 or direction = 2.

#### **Test Result**

Run the test code, the LED on the module gradually gets dimmer then brighter, cyclically, like human breathe.

### Project 44: Button-controlled LED

![](/media/50740b22d16151d490b8494b0bff4f6e.jpeg)

#### **Overview**

In this lesson, we will make an extension experiment with a button and an LED. When the button is pressed and low levels are output, the LED will light up; when the button is released, the LED will go off. Then we can control a module with another module.

**Test Code**

```python

 * * Keyestudio 42 in 1 Starter Kit for Raspberry Pi Pico
 * lesson 44
 * button control LED
 * http://www.keyestudio.com
'''
from machine import Pin
import time

button = Pin(16, Pin.IN)
LED = Pin(15, Pin.OUT)
touch = False

def toggle_handle(pin):
    global touch
    touch = not touch

button.irq(trigger = Pin.IRQ_FALLING, handler = toggle_handle)

while True:
    LED.value(touch)
    time.sleep(0.01)
```

#### **Code Explanation**

1\. **button.irq(trigger = Pin.IRQ\_FALLING, handler = toggle\_handle):** trigger mode is when high levels change into low levels, the trigger interrupts

2\. **toggle\_handle**: when entering the interrupt mode, the on and off of the LED can be controlled.

3\. Set IO ports according to connection diagram and configure pins mode:

**attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(button), toggle\_handle, FALLING)**

The trigger mode is when a high level becomes a low level. When the trigger interrupts, the interrupt function will be activated.

**toggle\_handle**: when entering the interrupt mode, the on and off of the LED can be controlled.

#### **Test Result**

Run the test code and press the button, LED will light up; if the button is pressed again, the LED will go out.

Upload the code wire up and power up with a USB cable. When the button is pressed, the LED will light up; when pressed again, the LED will go off.

**Test Code**

```python
'''
 * * Keyestudio 42 in 1 Starter Kit for Raspberry Pi Pico
 * lesson 45
 * Avoiding alarm
 * http://www.keyestudio.com
'''
from machine import Pin
import time

buzzer = Pin(16, Pin.OUT)
sensor = Pin(15, Pin.IN)
while True:
    buzzer.value(not(sensor.value()))
    time.sleep(0.01)
```

#### **Code Explanation**

1\. When an obstacle is detected, sensor.value() will return a low level signal. So when an obstacle is detected, the GP16 connected to the buzzer pin will output a high level signal, the buzzer will emit sounds.

2\. Set IO ports according to connection diagram then configure pins mode:

The value is 0 when pressing the button, So, we can determine the key value(0）through **if (item == 0) and make the buzzer beep.**

#### **Test Result**

Run the test code. The active buzzer will emit sound if detecting obstacles; otherwise, it won’t emit sound.

Upload the test code, if the obstacle is detected, the active buzzer will chime; if not, it won’t beep.

import machine
import utime

sensor_pir = machine.Pin(15, machine.Pin.IN, machine.Pin.PULL_DOWN)
led = machine.Pin(25, machine.Pin.OUT)
buzzer = machine.Pin(16, machine.Pin.OUT)

def pir_handler(pin):

sensor_pir.irq(trigger=machine.Pin.IRQ_RISING, handler=pir_handler)

while True:
    led.toggle()
    buzzer.value(0)
    utime.sleep(2)
```

#### **Code Explanation**

**sensor\_pir.irq(trigger=machine.Pin.IRQ\_RISING, handler=pir\_handler):** low levels change into high levels. pir\_handler is the interrupt function which can make the buzzer emit and LED flash

#### **Test Result**

After programming, the LED flashes slowly, the detector starts to work, and the interrupt trigger mode is IRQ\_RISING. When there is an intrusion, the output level of the PIR changes from 0 to 1, the pir\_handler() function will be called, the buzzer will emit sound, and the LED will flash quickly.

### Project 48: Speaker Module

![](/media/7009513ee4deade529bb95ea74dfe58e.jpeg)

#### **Introduction**

We learned about controlling the speaker module to make sounds, play beats and adjust its volume. In fact, each song is a combination of specific beats and tones (frequencies). In this experiment, we use this speaker module to play a song.

The frequency of each tone is shown below.

**Bass**:

Beats are the time delay for each note. The larger the number, the longer the delay time. A note without a line in the spectrum is a beat, with a delay of 1s. while a beat with an underline is 1/2 of a beat without a line, with a delay of 0.5s, and a beat with two underlines is 1/4 of a beat without a line, with a delay of 0.25s. The 1/8 of a beat is with a delay of 0.125s.

We will take Happy Birthday Song as an example.

### Project 49: Extinguishing Robot

![](/media/a3ccd8168b26f2a183fa9feda1b015f3.jpeg)

#### **Description**

Today we will use Arduino simulation to build an extinguishing robot that will automatically sense the fire and start the fan. 

In this project we will learn how to build a very simple robot using pico, (detecting flames with a flame sensor, blowing out candles with a fan) can teach us basic concepts about robotics. Once you understand the basics below, you can build more complex robots.

**Test Code**

```python
'''
 * Keyestudio 42 in 1 Starter Kit for Raspberry Pi Pico
 * lesson 49
 * Self-extinguishing
 * http://www.keyestudio.com
'''
from machine import Pin
import time

#two pins of motors
INA = Pin(20, Pin.OUT)
INB = Pin(21, Pin.OUT)

flame_A = machine.ADC(26)

while True:
    value = flame_A.read_u16()
    print(value)
    if value < 30000:
        #start
        INA.value(0)
        INB.value(1)
    else:
        #stop
        INA.value(0)
        INB.value(0)
    time.sleep(0.1)
```

#### **Code Explanation**

In the code, we set the threshold value to 30000. When the analog value detected by the flame sensor is lower than the threshold value, the fan will be automatically turned on; otherwise, it will be turned off. For the driving method of the fan, please refer to the 130 Motor.

#### **Test Result**

Wire up and upload the test code，the shell shows the flame value. When this value is less than 30000, the fan will works to blow out the fire. Basically, the flame value can be set by yourself.

### Project 50: Rotary Encoder

![](/media/c6b4f1cedef06ed68d1c2e5ccf5c17d2.jpeg)

#### **Introduction**

In this lesson, we will control the LED on the RGB module to show different colors through a rotary encoder.

When designing the code, we need to divide the obtained values by 3 to get the remainders. The remainder is 0 and the LED will become red. The remainder is 1, the LED will become green. The remainder is 2, the LED will turn blue.

              pin_num_dt=19,
              min_val=0,
              reverse=False,
              range_mode=RotaryIRQ.RANGE_UNBOUNDED)

while True:
    val = r.value()
    print(val%3)
    if val%3 == 0:
        light(65535, 0, 0)
    elif val%3 == 1:
        light(0, 65535, 0)
    elif val%3 == 2:
        light(0, 0, 65535)
    time.sleep(0.1)
```

#### **Code Explanation**

In the experiment, we set the val to the remainder of Encoder\_Count divided by 3. Encoder\_Count is the value of the encoder. Then we can set pin 9(red), 10(green) and 11(blue) according to remainders.

Colors of LED can be controlled by remainders.

#### **Test Result**

Wire up, run the code and open the serial monitor. Rotate the knob of the rotary encoder to display the reminders, which can control colors of LED.

### Project 51: Rotary Potentiometer

![](/media/f71165ab140ae6b2aac093dc75785c96.jpeg)

#### **Introduction**

In the previous courses, we did experiments of breathing light and controlling LED with button. In this course, we do these two experiments by controlling the brightness of LED through an adjustable potentiometer. The brightness of LED is controlled by PWM values, and the range of analog values is the same as the PWM’s, from 0 to 65535.

After the code is set successfully, we can control the brightness of the LED on the module by rotating the potentiometer.

potentiometer = machine.ADC(26)

pwm = machine.PWM(machine.Pin(15))

while True:
    pot_value = potentiometer.read_u16()
    pwm.duty_u16(pot_value)
    utime.sleep(0.1)
```

#### **Code Explanation**

It is easy to control the brightness of the LED light by a potentiometer. Here we can find that MicroPython unifies the value range of the ADC between 0 and 65535, and assigns values directly, which is simple and convenient.

#### **Test Result**

Run the test code and turn the potentiometer on the module to adjust the brightness of the LED on the LED module.

### Project 53: Sound Activated Light

![](/media/f3ddb58e83a92a888d3e1d66f7456170.png)

#### **Introduction**

In this lesson, we will make a smart sound activated light using a sound sensor and an LED module. When we make a sound, the light will automatically turn on; when there is no sound, the lights will automatically turn off. 

How it works? Because the sound-controlled light is equipped with a sound sensor, and this sensor converts the intensity of external sound into a corresponding value. Then set a threshold, when the threshold is exceeded, the light will turn on, and when it is not exceeded, the light will go out.

#### **Components**

        time.sleep(3)
    else:
        led.value(0)
    time.sleep(0.1)
```

#### **Code Explanation**

We set the analog threshold value to 5000. If more than 5000, LED will be on 3s; on the contrary, it will be off.

#### **Test Result**

Run the test code, the shell monitor displays the corresponding volume value. When the analog value of sound is greater than 5000, the LED on the LED module will light up, otherwise it will go off.

#### **Code Explanation**

Define an integer variable val to store the analog value of the smoke sensor, and then we display the analog value in the four-digit digital tube, and then set a threshold, and when the threshold is reached, the buzzer will sound.

#### **Test Result**

Run the test code, wire up and power on. When the concentration of combustible gas exceeds the standard, the active buzzer module will give an alarm, and the four-digit digital tube will display the concentration value.

### Project 56: Alcohol Sensor

![](/media/15aeeab780f2bf5566d29cc50712d240.jpeg)

#### **Description**

In the last experiment, we made a smoke alarm. In this experiment, we combine the active buzzer, the MQ-3 alcohol sensor, and a four-digit digital tube to test the alcohol concentration through the alcohol sensor. Then, the concentration to control the active buzzer alarm and the four-digit digital tube to display the concentration. So as to achieve the simulation effect of alcohol detector.

### Project 57: 6812 Colorful LED

![](/media/33c9dd3932993a801689ce26543d76bd.png)

#### **Description**

We learned how to use the 6812 RGB module, we knew that this module can light up each LED through a pin. In this experiment, we will control the RGB module to display different colors. 

(Note: do not look directly at the LEDs for a long time to avoid damage to our eyes.)

### Project 58: Ultrasonic Radar

![](/media/19a7c30e24f0ec39da94912c5535b791.png)

#### **Description**

We know that bats use echoes to determine the direction and the location of their preys. In real life, sonar is used to detect sounds in the water. Since the attenuation rate of electromagnetic waves in water is very high, it cannot be used to detect signals, however, the attenuation rate of sound waves in the water is much smaller, so sound waves are most commonly used underwater for observation and measurement.

In this experiment, we will use a speaker module, an RGB module and a 4-digit tube display to make a device for detection through ultrasonic.

#### **Code Explanation**

We set sound frequency and light color by adjusting different distance range.

We can adjust the distance range in the code.

#### **Test Result**

Wire up according to the connection diagram upload the run the code and power up. When the ultrasonic sensor detects different distances, the buzzer will produce different frequencies of sound, the RGB will show different colors, and the measured distances are displayed on the 4-digit tube display.

### Project 59: IR Remote Control

![](/media/6e823de7db355fde0bc5fcb7c1cdc705.jpeg)

#### **Introduction**

In the previous experiments, we learned to turn on or turn off the LED, adjust the brightness of a light through PWM, and how to use the infrared receiver module. So in this experiment, we use an infrared remote control to control an LED module.

When we receive a value, we set the PWM value by the corresponding button value, thus you can adjust the brightness. Control the LED to turn on or turn off is in the same way. If we want to use the same button to control the LED to turn on or turn off, we can achieve it through the code.

```

#### **Code Explanation**

1\. We define a boolean variable. There are two boolean variables. true (true) or false (false), **boolean flag = true.**

2\. When we press the OK button, the value of infrared reception is 64. At this time, we need to set a boolean variable flag. When the flag is true (true), the LED is turned on, and when it is false (false), the LED is turned off and turned on. After the LED is on and set it to false. We press the OK key, the LED will be off.

#### **Test Result**

Wire up, upload the test code and open the Shell monitor. Press the OK button of the remote, the LED will be on; press it again, the LED will be off.

### Project 60: Heat Dissipation Device

![](/media/24a7a2d97a50c2f3fc4ab893d3aee394.jpeg)

#### **Description**

We will use a temperature sensor and some modules to make a smart cooling device in this experiment. When the ambient temperature is higher than a certain value, the motor is turned on, thereby reducing the ambient temperature and achieving the heat dissipation effect. Then display the temperature value in the four-digit segment display.

```

#### **Code Explanation**

The setting of variables and the storage of detection values are the same as what we learned earlier. We also set a temperature threshold and control the rotation of the motor when the threshold is exceeded, and then we use the digital tube to display the temperature value.

#### **Test Result**

Wire up and run the test code. We can see the temperature of the current environment (unit is Celsius) on the four-digit segment display, as shown in the figure below. If this value exceeds the value we set, the fan will rotate to dissipate heat.

### Project 61: Intelligent Entrance Guard System

![](/media/6dbae618241cc2dd3060dc4abf94f3a6.jpeg)

#### **Description**

In this project, we use the RFID522 card swiping module and the servo to set up an intelligent access control system. The principle is very simple. We use RFID522 swipe card module, an IC card or key card to unlock.

#### **Required Components**

```

#### **Code Explanation**

In the previous experiment, our card swipe module has tested the information of IC card and key. Then we use this corresponding information to control the door.

#### **Test Result**

Upload the test code, wire up and power up with a USB cable, open the shell and set the baud rate to 9600; the shell displays information.

When we use the IC card or blue key to swipe the card, the shell displays the card information and "open the door", as shown in the figure below, the servo rotates to the corresponding angle to simulate opening the door.

### Project 62: Comprehensive Experiment

![](/media/c92bfcbd1ecd7fe91198066d0c9a4df6.jpeg)

#### **Introduction**

We did a lot of experiments, and for each one we needed to re-upload the code, so can we achieve different functions through an experiment? 

In this experiment, we will use an external button module to achieve different functions.

#### **Code Explanation**

1\. Calculate how many times the button is pressed, divide it by 8, and get the remainder which is 0, 1 2, 3, 4, 5 , 6 and 7. According to different remainders, construct five unique functions to control the experiment and realize different functions.

2\. We add dht and adxl345 library files in this project.

![](/media/933650fe28e30e198feb7adc6e88c7f2.jpeg)
