## Description

The Keyestudio Raspberry Pi Pico 42 in 1 sensor kit mainly contains 37 commonly used sensors/modules, a Raspberry Pi Pico board, a Raspberry Pi Pico expansion board and Dupont wires.

The 42 sensors and modules are fully compatible with the Raspberry Pi Pico shield. You only need to stack the Raspberry Pi Pico board onto the Raspberry Pi Pico shield, and hook up them with Dupont wires, which is simple and convenient.

To make you master the electronic knowledge, detailed tutorials (Micropython), schematic diagrams, wiring methods and test code are included. Through these projects, you will have a better understanding about programming, logic and electronics.

## Raspberry Pi Pico & Thonny

![image-20231106153635259](media/image-20231106153635259.png)

At the end of January 2021, the Raspberry Pi Foundation launched the Raspberry Pi Pico, which received a lot of attention due to its high-performance and low-cost.

The size of Pico is 21mm \*51mm, which is similar to Arduino Nano.

Raspberry Pi Pico is a low-cost, high-performance microcontroller board with flexible digital interfaces. It integrates the RP2040 microcontroller chip designed by Raspberry Pi, with dual-core Arm Cortex M0+ processor running up to 133 MHz, embedded 264KB of SRAM and 2MB of on-board Flash memory, as well as 26 multi-function GPIO pins. For software development, either Raspberry Pi's C/C++ SDK, or the MicroPython is available. In this tutorial, we will use MicroPython.

![image-20231106153648353](media/image-20231106153648353.png)

The bare board does not come with pins and you need to solder yourself. This is a well-made board that can also be used as an SMD component and soldered directly to a printed circuit board.

![image-20230508095513903](media/image-20230508095513903.png)

The most predominant feature on the board is the microUSB connector at one end. This is used both for communication and to supply power to the Pico. An on-board LED is mounted next to the microUSB connector, it is internally connected to GPIO pin 25. It’s worthwhile to note that this is the only LED on the entire Pico board. 

The BOOTSEL pushbutton switch is mounted a bit down from the LED, it allows you to change the boot mode of the Pico so that you can load MicroPython onto it and perform drag-and-drop programming.

At the bottom of the board, you’ll see three connections, these are for a serial Debug option that we won’t be exploring here.

In the center of the board is the brains of the whole thing, the RP2040 MCU, which is capable of supporting up to 16MB of off-chip Flash memory, although in the Pico there is only 4MB.

  - Dual-core 32-bit Arm Cortex M0+ processor

  - Runs at 48MHz, but can be overclocked to 133MHz

  - 30 GPIO pins

  - Can support USB Host or Device mode

  - 8 Programmable I/O(PIO) state machines

The Pico is a 3.3V logic device, however, it can be powered with a range of power supplies thanks to a built-in voltage converter and regulator.

**GND:** Ground connection. 8 grounding wires plus an additional one on the 3-pin Debug connector. They are square as opposed to rounded like the other connections.

**VBUS:** This is the power from the microUSB bus, 5 V. If the Pico is not being powered by the microUSB connector then there will be no output here.

**VSYS:** This is the input voltage, which can range from 2 to 5V. The on-board voltage converter will change it to 3.3V for the Pico.

**3V3:** This is a 3.3V output from the Pico’s internal regulator. It can be used to power additional components, providing you keep the load under 300ma.

**3V3\_EN:** You can use this input to disable the Pico’s internal voltage regulator, which will shut off the Pico and any components powered by it.

**RUN:** It can enable or disable the RP2040 microcontroller, it can also reset it.

There are 26 exposed GPIO connections on the Raspberry Pi Pico board.They are laid out pretty-well in order, with a“gap”between GP22 and GP26 (those“missing”pins are used internally). All these pins have multiple functions, and you can configure up to 16 of them for PWM. There are two I2C buses, two UARTs, and two SPI buses, these can be configured to use a wide variety of GPIO pins. 

The Pico has three Analog-to-Digital Converters, they are ADC0-GP26, ADC1-GP27, ADC2-GP28, and plus ADC-VREF converter used internally for an on-board temperature sensor. Note: The ADCs have a 12-bit resolution. However, the Micropython has scaled the 12-bit resolution into a 16-bit resolution, which means that we will receive ADC values from 0 to 65535. The microcontroller’s working voltage is 3.3V, indicating that 0 corresponds to 0V and 65535 corresponds to 3.3V.

You can also provide an external precision voltage-reference on the ADC_VREF pin. One of the grounds, the ADC_GND on pin 33 is used as a ground point for that reference.
